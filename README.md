## Installation

### Desktop App
Download the latest release for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/glitchedgitz/grroxy/releases):

Currently I have applied for the apple developer id, current workaround for 

```
xattr -cr /Applications/Grroxy.app
```

If you prefer using grroxy from the terminal without the desktop app:

**Go Install:**

```bash
go install github.com/glitchedgitz/grroxy/cmd/grroxy@latest
go install github.com/glitchedgitz/grroxy/cmd/grroxy-app@latest
go install github.com/glitchedgitz/grroxy/cmd/grroxy-tool@latest
go install -v github.com/glitchedgitz/cook/v2/cmd/cook@latest
```

**Or download binaries** from [Releases](https://github.com/glitchedgitz/grroxy/releases) and add to your PATH.

Then run:

```bash
grroxy start

# Web UI - http://127.0.0.1:8090
