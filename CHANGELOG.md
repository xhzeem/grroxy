## [2026-MAR] - Fuzzer: Unified Markers with Inline Payloads

### Added

- **Fuzzer: Inline Payloads via `markers`** — Each marker value can now be either a string (wordlist file path) or an array of strings (inline payloads). Both types can be mixed in the same request. Inline payloads support multi-line values since they are iterated by index, not split by newlines.
- **Fuzzer: `generated_by` field** — Track what generated a fuzzer request (e.g., "manual", "workflow").
- **Fuzzer: `process_data` field** — Attach arbitrary metadata to a fuzzer process.
- **Fuzzer: `Failed` process state** — Fuzzer processes that encounter errors are now marked as "Failed" with error details.
- **Fuzzer: `markerSource` abstraction** — Internal interface (`fileSource`, `sliceSource`) replaces raw `bufio.Reader` for all marker iteration, enabling correct multi-line payload support.

### Changed

- **Fuzzer: Removed separate `payloads` field** — The `markers` field now handles both file paths and inline payloads via type detection. No separate `payloads` field needed.
- **Fuzzer: Improved validation** — Validates marker types (must be string or array), empty values, and provides clearer error messages.

### Fixed

- **Fuzzer: Pitch fork last-item dispatch** — Fixed bug where the last payload in pitch_fork mode was skipped when EOF arrived with the final value.
- **Fuzzer: Cleaned up wordlist initialization** — Removed debug code from fuzzer core.

### Technical Notes

#### HTTP vs HTTPS Proxy Behavior

The proxy handles HTTP and HTTPS requests differently as per RFC 7230:

**HTTP (Plain) - Absolute URI:**

- Proxy receives absolute URI in request line
- Proxy transforms to relative path for upstream
- Host header preserved for virtual hosting at origin

**HTTPS (Encrypted) - CONNECT Tunnel:**

- Proxy establishes TCP tunnel with CONNECT
- Client sends relative paths inside encrypted tunnel
- With MITM: Proxy decrypts, processes, and re-encrypts
- Without MITM: Proxy acts as passthrough tunnel

This behavioral difference is standard HTTP proxy protocol. The `RequestURI` field is cleared before forwarding to upstream as Go's `http.Transport` expects it empty.
