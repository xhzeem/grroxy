## [2025-OCT] - Core Update #23

### Added

- Separate relational collections (`_req`, `_resp`, `_req_edited`, `_resp_edited`) with proper indexing
- Direct channel-based communication between API and goroutines for improved performance
- Raw HTTP strings now stored in `raw` field of respective collections
- Retained JSON fields `req_json`, `resp_json`, `req_edited_json`, `resp_edited_json` for backward compatibility

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Migrated from JSON-based storage to separate relational collections for significant performance improvements
  - **Previously**: Request/response data stored as JSON in `req` and `resp` columns of `_data`
  - **Now**: Separate collections with proper relational structure and indexing
- **BREAKING**: Moved from typed structs to `map[string]any` for direct database operations
  - Directly usable for inserting to database, checking filter and running templates
  - Struct definitions retained for manual reference

- Improved data flow and operations with direct database access patterns

### Fixed

- Significantly reduced database operations while inserting/modifying new records
- Better type safety and query performance with relational collections
- Faster queries with proper indexing on relational collections

- `RawProxyWrapper` in `api/app/proxy_rawproxy.go` for rawproxy integration
- `RequestData` struct in rawproxy for passing context between handlers
- Fixed certificate location at `~/.config/grroxy/`
- Certificate generation on application startup in `setConfig()`
- Comprehensive logging system with detailed error tracking

### Changed

- Improved certificate serving consistency across all components

### Removed

- `GetStats()` API endpoint (use direct database queries instead)

### Technical Notes

#### HTTP vs HTTPS Proxy Behavior

The proxy handles HTTP and HTTPS requests differently as per RFC 7230:

**HTTP (Plain) - Absolute URI:**

- Proxy receives absolute URI in request line
- Proxy transforms to relative path for upstream
- Host header preserved for virtual hosting at origin

**HTTPS (Encrypted) - CONNECT Tunnel:**

- Proxy establishes TCP tunnel with CONNECT
- Client sends relative paths inside encrypted tunnel
- With MITM: Proxy decrypts, processes, and re-encrypts
- Without MITM: Proxy acts as passthrough tunnel

This behavioral difference is standard HTTP proxy protocol. The `RequestURI` field is cleared before forwarding to upstream as Go's `http.Transport` expects it empty.
